Welcome to the BNMI 2025 Symposium – 4th annual meeting of the Bridging Nordic Microscopy Infrastructure  

The BNMI 2025 Symposium will be hosted by the Centre for Cellular Imaging at the University of Gothenburg, Sweden, from August 19–22, 2025. This prestigious event will bring together leading scientists from across basic and applied imaging research, along with key industry representatives, for three days of insightful discussions and collaboration. Held at the Wallenberg Conference Center, the venue is easily accessible, just a short tram or bus ride from Gothenburg’s city center.
<br><br>
Our primary objective is to create an engaging and dynamic symposium that appeals to imaging researchers across disciplines. By bringing together experts from diverse imaging modalities, we aim to foster meaningful collaborations that advance the field. Whether early in your career or an experienced researcher, BNMI 2025 offers a unique opportunity to stay updated on cutting-edge imaging technologies, learn new techniques, and build valuable connections within the imaging community. The symposium will also showcase imaging research conducted by Gothenburg’s scientific community.
<br><br>
The program will feature a compelling mix of lectures, poster sessions, and selected short talks from poster presenters, covering topics from electron and light microscopy, X-ray imaging, to advanced image analysis. Attendees will have numerous opportunities to engage in both formal discussions and informal gatherings, enriching both scientific dialogue and networking.  Sessions will focus on these key areas in imaging research:
