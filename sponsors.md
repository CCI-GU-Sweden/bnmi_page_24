The commercial exhibition will be held adjacent to the Wallenberg Lecture Hall at the Wallenberg Conference Center, a modern venue with excellent accessibility and robust infrastructure, ideal for hosting a technically demanding exhibition. All exhibitor stands will be conveniently located within the same area.

We extend our gratitude to our sponsors for their invaluable support:
