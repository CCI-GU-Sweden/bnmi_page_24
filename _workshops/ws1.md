<p>
Discover how automation is revolutionizing microscopy in our Smart Microscopy workshop. This state-of-the-art approach combines on-the-fly image analysis with fully motorized, computer-controlled microscopes to create adaptive, real-time imaging workflows. By enabling dynamic adjustments to microscope parameters during experiments, Smart Microscopy minimizes human intervention, allowing researchers to efficiently capture rare events, study complex biological systems and acquire statistically meaningful data.
</p>
<p>
Over one and a half days, participants will delve into the principles and practices of Smart Microscopy, using both commercial and open-source tools. Hands-on sessions will cover target identification, adaptive feedback loops, and integration with external hardware and software for advanced automation. The workshop emphasizes transferable strategies, ensuring participants can develop adaptive workflows tailored to their specific instruments. Join us to explore how Smart Microscopy can enhance your experimental efficiency and data reproducibility.
</p>

<p>
The workshop will be divided into four sessions:
<div class="bullet-div" markdown="1">
* CARL ZEISS – Smart Imaging Workflows for Scalable, Automated Acquisition.
* Nikon – Experience Smart Microscopy with BergmanLabora & Nikon
* Leica – SpectraPlex for STELLARIS: 3D High-Multiplex Imaging for Spatial Discoveries
* Webknossos – Visualize, share, and annotate your large 3D images online
