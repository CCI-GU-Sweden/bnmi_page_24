    <b>1. Train-the-trainer workshop: how to improve your own training </b>
        <div class="bullet-div">
        <p>Have you ever experienced that users donâ€™t seem to remember much of what you taught them when you trained them? How can we improve the way we train users so that they really learn?
        Pedagogy is the science of how we learn and how to design effective teaching. Pedagogical tools are simple to apply and have a great potential for improving the learning outcome of microscopy trainings.
        <br><br> 
        During this 2h workshop, we will guide you to improve the design of your own microscopy training, in small steps and at your own pace.

        <b>2. Smart Microscopy</b>
        <div class="bullet-div">
        <p>
            Discover how automation is revolutionizing microscopy in our Smart Microscopy workshop. This state-of-the-art approach combines on-the-fly image analysis with fully motorized, computer-controlled microscopes to create adaptive, real-time imaging workflows. By enabling dynamic adjustments to microscope parameters during experiments, Smart Microscopy minimizes human intervention, allowing researchers to efficiently capture rare events, study complex biological systems, and acquire statistically meaningful data.
            <br><br>
            Over one and a half days, participants will delve into the principles and practices of Smart Microscopy, using both commercial and open-source tools. Hands-on sessions will cover target identification, adaptive feedback loops, and integration with external hardware and software for advanced automation. The workshop emphasizes transferable strategies, ensuring participants can develop adaptive workflows tailored to their specific instruments. Join us to explore how Smart Microscopy can enhance your experimental efficiency and data reproducibility.

        <b>3. Optical Tissue Clearing Techniques for 3D Lightsheet</b>
            <div class="bullet-div">
            <p>
            Unlock the potential of deep imaging with this workshop on Optical Tissue Clearing Techniques, designed to complement 3D lightsheet microscopy. Tissue clearing transforms biological specimens into transparent structures, allowing for unprecedented imaging depth without physical sectioning. Paired with lightsheet microscopy, tissue clearing enables researchers to visualize intact 3D biological structures, from neuronal networks to entire organs, with high precision and minimal photobleaching.
            <br><br>
            This one-and-a-half-day workshop provides practical training on tissue clearing workflows tailored to lightsheet microscopy. Participants will cover essential topics, including sample preparation techniques for various tissue types, mounting strategies for effective imaging on systems like the Zeiss Light Sheet 7, and basic data management and processing for large datasets. With a focus on adaptability, attendees will learn how to optimize clearing protocols for their samples and fluorescence labels, empowering them to extend these techniques to their own research.
