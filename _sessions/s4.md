title: "Enabling imaging across scales:"
---

 The rapid advancement of imaging technologies over the past two decades has propelled significant biological and medical discoveries. Integrating complementary imaging modalities enables a comprehensive, multi-scale view of a sample, capturing both structural and functional parameters from the same specimen. Breakthroughs in electron and light microscopy now provide unprecedented visualization of molecular structures. As imaging modalities increasingly overlap across microscopic, mesoscopic, and macroscopic scales, they offer deeper insights into complex biological processes, including development, immune function, and disease progression. The future of multi-scale imaging will not only depend on advances in hardware and probes but also on computational innovations in data analysis and integration, further enhancing our understanding of health and disease.
