title: Smart Microscopy - from Image Analysis, artifical inteligence to Intelligent Acquisition
---

 Smart microscopy refers to microscopes that can perform real-time analysis and adjust their imaging parameters on-the-fly based on feedback from the acquired images, without human intervention. These microscopes utilize feedback loops to directly read and process the images, and then feed that information back to optimize the imaging regime.
