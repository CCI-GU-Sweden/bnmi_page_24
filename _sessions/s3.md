title: Mesoscopy â€“ Dynamic interactions in cells, organoids, tissue, and entire organisms
---

 Temporal imaging is essential to uncover and quantify complex dynamic information in biological systems. In tissues and organs, cells form complex, functional structures and interact dynamically. This session will focus on multi-scale live imaging, from 2D and 3D cell cultures to whole organisms, and will highlight the role of state-of-the-art imaging techniques (e.g., light-sheet and 3-Photon Microscopy) in the unveiling of new biological processes. Among the topics covered by this session are recent advances in organoid imaging, tissue imaging and intravital imaging used to study cell-cell interactions, proliferation and differentiation during development and regeneration
