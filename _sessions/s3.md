title: Imaging sub-cellular events at high resolution using advanced light microscopy
---
Observing sub-cellular structures at the smallest scale is crucial for advancing biomedical research and enhancing our understanding of biological processes. Recent innovations have led to faster acquisition speeds, single-molecule trajectory tracking, high-throughput imaging, and the development of novel probes. These advancements in resolution are driven by specialized sample preparation techniques, optical engineering, and sophisticated image analysis, enabling the detailed exploration of nanoscale structures within cells and tissues. This session will highlight cutting-edge developments in super-resolution imaging such as MINFLUX, MIN-STED, and Expansion Microscopy—an approach that physically enlarges biological samples to achieve nanoscale resolution—demonstrating their transformative impact on visualizing complex cellular structures.
