title:  Correlative Multimodal Imaging â€“ Imaging Across Scales
---

Combining complementary imaging modalities can generate a highly informative, composite view of the sample and allows access to both structural and functional parameters across all relevant scales from the same sample. While the correlation of light with transmission electron microscopy (EM) is well established (generally referred to as CLEM), the frontiers of bioimaging are currently being pushed towards the integration of other modalities into correlative workflows, including both super-resolution and large-scale imaging techniques such as light sheet, X-ray or Volume EM to study intercellular relationships and put molecular information into its overall structural context.
