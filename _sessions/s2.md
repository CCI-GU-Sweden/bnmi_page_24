title: Imaging sub-cellular events at high resolution using advanced light microscopy
---
Observing sub-cellular structures at the smallest scale is crucial in biomedical research for deepening our understanding of biological processes. Recent advancements include faster acquisition speeds, tracking single molecule trajectories during imaging, high-throughput approaches, and the development of new probes. This enhanced resolution is achieved through specialized sample preparation techniques, optical engineering, and image analysis. It allows the exploration of nanoscale structures within cells and tissues. This session will discuss novel advancements in super-resolution imaging, including methods that facilitate super-resolution imaging in live cells, such as MINFLUX, MIN-STED, and SR-SIM, rapid single molecule imaging, and Expansion Microscopy will be highlighted.
