title: "Exploring Emerging Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence for Microscopy: An Overview of Trends and Innovations"
---
 In recent years, there has been a growing trend toward adopting AI-based solutions in microscopy. These tools are increasingly being used for optimizing image acquisition (smart microscopy) and improving the overall efficiency and precision of image analysis workflows. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) is now transforming the microscopy landscape, acting as a “second pair of eyes” to enhance image analysis. AI-powered tools are being trained to perform complex tasks such as object and image classification, segmentation, image restoration, super-resolution imaging, and virtual staining. These advancements are proving invaluable in areas like patient diagnostics and cancer research, enabling scientists to achieve higher resolution and gain faster, more accurate insights.
